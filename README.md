# Thunderbird Updater

Manage a local thunderbird install. Primarilly built since I don't have root access
on LiU's computers and the only mailprogram there is *evolution*.

## Extending the progarm & merge requests

Merge requests are encouraged, and I'm open to extend the program's functionallity.
